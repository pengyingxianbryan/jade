description: Execute plan with GitHub gate + RED/GREEN/REFACTOR TDD enforcement per task
argument-hint: "[plan-path]"
allowed-tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion]
---

<objective>
Execute an approved PLAN.md file with strict TDD enforcement and GitHub integration.

**When to use:** After PLAN phase complete and plan is approved (APPROVE received).

Every task runs through RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with hard gates. Every task gets its own branch and PR. Every task updates its local TASK-NN.md status independently.
</objective>

<context>
Plan path: $ARGUMENTS

@.pm/STATE.md
</context>

<!-- GITHUB GATE — HARD                               -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="github_gate" priority="first">
**Before writing a single line of code, verify GitHub remote:**

1. Run `git remote -v` — confirm origin is set to the configured repo URL
2. Run `git ls-remote origin HEAD` — confirm remote is reachable
3. Run `git status` — confirm working tree is clean or on correct branch

**If ANY check fails: STOP immediately.**
Print exactly what failed. Do not write a single line of code.

```
GitHub gate failed: [specific error]

[Diagnostic info]

Fix the issue and run /pm:apply again.

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- VALIDATE PLAN & LOCAL FILES                      -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="validate_plan">
1. Confirm plan file exists at $ARGUMENTS path (or find current plan from STATE.md)
2. Error if not found: "Plan not found: {path}"
3. Derive SUMMARY path (replace PLAN.md with SUMMARY.md)
4. If SUMMARY exists: "Plan already executed. SUMMARY: {path}"
5. Read all tasks from the Tasks section
6. Read Boundaries — these files are OFF LIMITS during execution
7. Verify STORY.md exists in the phase directory
8. Verify tasks/ directory exists with TASK-NN.md files for each task
9. If any local files missing: create them from PLAN.md content (fallback)
</step>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- UPDATE STORY STATUS                              -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="story_start">
Update the phase's STORY.md:
- Set `Status` to `In Progress`

Update STATE.md:
- Loop position: APPLY
- Status: In Progress
</step>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- TDD LOOP — PER TASK                              -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="tdd_loop">
**For each task in the plan (skip tasks where TASK-NN.md shows Status: Done):**

```
─── Task [N]: [task name] ──────────────────────────────

1. UPDATE TASK STATUS
   Update tasks/TASK-{NN}.md: set Status to "In Progress"

2. CREATE TASK BRANCH
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b pm/{phase-name}-task-{N}

3. RED phase
   a. Identify test file for this task from Files field
   b. Write the failing test. Touch ONLY test files.
   c. Run: [test command from Verification field]
   d. Confirm output shows FAIL for the new test

   GATE: If new test passes before implementation → STOP.
         This means either the test is wrong or the feature already exists.
         Report to user and wait for instruction. Do not proceed.

4. GREEN phase
   a. Write minimal implementation. Touch ONLY implementation files.
   b. Run: [test command from Verification field]
   c. Confirm ALL tests pass — new and existing.

   GATE: If any existing test breaks → STOP.
         Report exactly which tests broke and why. Do not proceed.

5. REFACTOR phase
   a. Clean up implementation. No new behaviour introduced.
   b. Run: [test command from Verification field]
   c. Confirm still all green.

   GATE: If any test fails after refactor → STOP.
         Undo refactor changes and report.
```

**BOUNDARY CHECK:** Before writing any file, verify it is NOT listed in Boundaries > Do Not Change section. If it is, STOP and report.

**IMPLEMENTATION-BEFORE-TEST CHECK:** If implementation code for a task exists before the failing test is written, DELETE IT. Start clean. This is not negotiable.

**DESIGN QUALITY CHECK:** If the task involves frontend UI (components, pages, layouts, animations), activate the `designer-uxui` skill from `skills/designer-uxui/SKILL.md`. During REFACTOR phase, run the skill's Review Checklist against all UI code produced. Violations must be fixed before the task is marked complete.

<!-- COMMIT, PUSH & PR — PER TASK                     -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="commit_push_pr">
After all three TDD phases pass for a task:

1. **Stage and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: task [N] — [task name]

   - RED: [test file] — X tests added, confirmed failing
   - GREEN: [impl file] — all X tests passing
   - REFACTOR: cleanup applied

   ```

2. **Push:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin pm/{phase-name}-task-{N}
   ```

3. **Create PR for review:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create \
     --title "Task [N]: [task name]" \
     --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   ## Summary
   [What this task delivers — from TASK-NN.md description]

   ## TDD Results

   | GREEN | All Y tests passing |

     --base main \

4. **Ask user to review:**
   ```

   ════════════════════════════════════════

   Task [N]: [task name]
   PR: [PR URL]

   ────────────────────────────────────────
   Review the PR and merge it to continue.
   Say "merged" when ready to proceed.

   ```

   **HARD STOP.** Wait for user to confirm merge before proceeding to next task.
</step>

<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- UPDATE LOCAL STATUS — PER TASK                   -->
<!-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

<step name="update_task_status">
**After user confirms PR is merged:**

1. Update `tasks/TASK-{NN}.md` — set completion record:
   ```
   | Status | Done |
   | Completed At | [ISO timestamp] |
   | Commit SHA | [short SHA] |
   | Tests Added | X |
   | Tests Passing | Y |
   | PR URL | [URL] |
   | Branch | pm/{phase-name}-task-{N} |
   ```

2. Mark all acceptance criteria checkboxes in TASK-NN.md as checked.

3. Update PLAN.md task status to `done` with completion metadata.

4. Update STORY.md task table — mark this task as `Done`.

5. Update STATE.md TDD Results section:
   ```
   task_[N]: RED ✓ | GREEN ✓ | REFACTOR ✓ | tests_added: X | passing: Y
   ```

6. Checkout main and pull:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

7. Proceed to next task.

When a checkpoint task is reached (non-auto tasks):

**checkpoint:decision**
- Present decision context and options

- Record decision
- Continue execution

**checkpoint:human-verify**
- Present what was built
- Present verification steps
- Wait for "approved" or issue description
- Continue execution

**checkpoint:human-action**
- Present required action
- Wait for "done" confirmation

After all tasks in the current phase complete:

1. Check ROADMAP.md: are there more phases?
2. If yes:
   - Present: "Phase [N] complete. Phase [N+1] plan exists."
   - Ask: "Would you like to **review/revise** the plan for Phase [N+1], or **continue** as planned?"
   - If "revise" → instruct user to run `/pm:plan --revise N+1`
   - If "continue" → proceed to UNIFY for current phase
3. If no more phases: proceed to UNIFY (final)
